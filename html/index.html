                <h2>Types of superheroes</h2>   
                <p>Superheroes come in many forms, each with unique abilities, backgrounds, and purposes. One of the most common types is the superhuman or enhanced hero, whose powers go beyond normal human limits. These heroes possess extraordinary strength, speed, endurance, or durability, often gained through genetic mutations, scientific experiments, or supernatural forces. Superman, for example, is an alien whose physiology gives him godlike strength and flight, while Captain America was transformed into a super-soldier through experimental serum. These heroes are often seen as symbols of hope, using their incredible abilities to protect humanity from powerful threats.</p>
